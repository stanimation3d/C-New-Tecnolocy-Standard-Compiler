# C New Tecnology Standart Compiler
C New Technology Standard Compiler is a standard compiler developed for the new programming language called C New Technology, which is developed by Sahne Dünya and is made of LLVM. If you are asking what programming language C New Technology is. C New Technology is a programming language based on C/C++ developed by Sahne Dünya but equipped with modern features. Why was the C New Technology programming language developed? The main reason for the development of this programming language is that there are always programming languages ​​such as D and Rust in C/C++ alternatives, but none of these languages ​​are directly compatible with C/C++, However, C New Technology is a language directly compatible with C/C++. This is very important because C/C++ has been an indispensable option in system programming and high-performance applications for many years, but due to the lack of modern features, alternatives such as D and Rust were developed but they could be popular for a longer time because none of them are directly compatible with C/C++! C New Technology has both modern features and is based on C/C++ and is fully compatible, which will make it more popular than other alternatives. If sufficient support is implemented! At the same time, C/C++ is closed source, while C New Technology is open source and independent of ISO standards and This compiler is the Standard compiler developed for this language. First, RISC-V support is planned for cross-platform support.

# Basic features
1. File extensions: source file: .cnt, header file: .hnt (In this programming language, there is no need for a Header file like in classic C/C++, but you can optionally use a Header file)
2. Basically supported programming: Object-oriented (OOP)
3. Memory management: ownership and borrowing
4. Control structures: Patterm Matting (match)
5. Module system: Import
6. Base programming language: C/C++
7. Compiler infrastructure: LLVM
